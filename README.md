# Interview Questions Project

This repository contains a collection of interview questions and projects focused on Python and React. It's designed to help developers prepare for technical interviews and improve their skills in these technologies.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main subdirectories:

```
.
├── python-interview-questions/
└── react-interview-questions/
```

### Python Interview Questions

The `/python-interview-questions` subdirectory contains an assortment of traditional interview questions solved using Python. These questions cover various topics such as:

- Data Structures (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs)
- Algorithms (e.g., Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming)
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Python-specific features and best practices

Each question is typically presented with:

- Problem statement
- Solution implementation in Python
- Explanation of the approach
- Time and space complexity analysis

### React Interview Questions

The `/react-interview-questions` subdirectory contains several different React projects that are meant to test various React concepts. These projects cover topics such as:

- Component lifecycle
- State management (including hooks)
- Props and component communication
- Routing
- API integration
- Performance optimization
- Testing React applications

Each project is a self-contained React application demonstrating one or more React concepts.

## Getting Started

### Python Questions

1. Navigate to the Python questions directory:
   ```
   cd python-interview-questions
   ```
2. Run any Python file using:
   ```
   python3 filename.py
   ```

### React Projects

1. Navigate to a specific React project directory:
   ```
   cd react-interview-questions/project-name
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
